# COMP4106
COMP4106 is an artificial intelligence class covering many techniques for solving problems. The problems solved here are not overly difficult but for learning.

Note: Code quality here was not a priority as the assignment code was not to be submitted, only demoed.

### A1
Implemented a DFS, BFS and an A-Star search for solving a different versions of "Peg Solitaire" using Rust. First project ever attempting rust with.

### A2
Implementing minimax with alpha-beta pruning for the board game "Overboard".

### A3
Implementing different types of finite automata to test reinforcement learning.

### Final Project
Free reign to choose what we wanted. I chose to create an AI to solve upper-level sudoku boards (beyond the 9x9, 14x14, and 25x25, although the code was size-agnostic). Techniques included constraint propagation, and an A-Star search with an adaptive heuristic (heuristic that applied some reinforcement learning techniques).
